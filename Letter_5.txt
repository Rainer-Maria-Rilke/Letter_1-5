Rome
October 29, 1903
Dear Sir,
I received your letter of August 29 in Florence, and it has taken me this long
— two months — to answer. Please forgive this tardiness — but I don’t like to
write letters while I am traveling, because for letter writing I need more than the
most necessary tools: some silence and solitude and a not too familiar hour.
We arrived in Rome about six weeks ago, at a time when it was still empty, the
hot, the notoriously feverish Rome, and this circumstance, along with other
practical difficulties in finding a place to live, helped make the restlessness around
us seem as if it would never end, and the unfamiliarity lay upon us with the
weight of homelessness. In addition, Rome (if one has not yet become acquainted
with it) makes one feel stifled with sadness for the first few days: through the
gloomy and lifeless museum-atmosphere that it exhales, through the abundance
of its pasts, which are brought forth and laboriously held up (pasts on which a
tiny present subsists), through the terrible overvaluing, sustained by scholars and
philologists and imitated by the ordinary tourist in Italy, of all the disfigured and
decaying Things, which, after all, are essentially nothing more than accidental
remains from another time and from a life that is not and should not be ours.
Finally, after weeks of daily resistance, one finds oneself somewhat composed
again, even though still a bit confused, and one says to oneself: No, there is not
more beauty here than in other places, and all these objects, which have been
marveled at by generation after generation, mended and restored by the hands of
workmen, mean nothing, are nothing, and have no heart and no value; — but
there is much beauty here, because everywhere there is much beauty. Waters
infinitely full of life move along the ancient aqueducts into the great city and
dance in the many city squares over white basins of stone and spread out in large,
spacious pools and murmur by day and lift up their murmuring to the night,
which is vast here and starry and soft with winds. And there are gardens here,
unforgettable boulevards, and staircases designed by Michelangelo, staircases
constructed on the pattern of downward-gliding waters and, as they descend,
widely giving birth to step out of wave. Through such impressions one gathers
oneself, wins oneself back from the exacting multiplicity, which speaks and
chatters there (and how talkative it is!), and one slowly learns to recognize the
very few Things in which something eternal endures that one can love and
something solitary that one can gently take part in.
I am still living in the city, on the Capitol, not far from the most beautiful
equestrian statue that has come down to us from Roman art — the statue of
Marcus Aurelius; but in a few weeks I will move into a quiet, simple room, an
old summerhouse, which lies lost deep in a large park, hidden from the city, from
its noises and incidents. There I will live all winter and enjoy the great silence,
from which I expect the gift of happy, work-filled hours. . . .
From there, where I will be more at home, I will write you a longer letter, in
which I will say something more about what you wrote me. Today I just need to
tell you (and perhaps I am wrong not to have done this sooner) that the book
you sent me (you said in your letter that it contained some works of yours) hasn’t
arrived. Was it sent back to you, perhaps from Worspwede? (They will not
forward packages to foreign countries.) This is the most hopeful possibility, and I
would be glad to have it confirmed. I do hope that the package hasn’t been lost
— unfortunately, the Italian mail service being what it is, that would not be
anything unusual.
I would have been glad to have this book (as I am to have anything that
comes from you); and any poems that have arisen in the meantime. I will always
(if you entrust them to me) read and read again and experience as well and
sincerely as I can. With greetings and good wishes,
Yours,
Rainer Maria Rilke
